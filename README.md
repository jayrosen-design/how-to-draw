## Overview
**How to Draw Tutorials** is a prototype application focusing on the fundamentals of drawing. Students follow a clear, step-by-step approach:
1. **Sketch** the subject with basic shapes using different pencil hardnesses.
2. **Refine** the sketch, adding details and correcting proportions.
3. **Ink** the outlines using adjustable black markers.
4. **Color** the drawing with a wide spectrum of markers.

The app is optimized for touchscreen tablets, making it easy for young learners to draw directly on the screen.
